# [데이터 구조 및 분석: Linear Structure and Dynamic Programming](https://kaist.edwith.org/datastructure-2019s#)

## OT

- Data Structure and Algorithm
- Textbooks
  - Introduction to Algorithm by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein

## Week 1

- 구현
  - Programming
- 설계도
  - UML
    - DS, Algorithm
- Python
  - Interpreter
  - Object-oriented
  - Dynamic type of variables
  - Increasing usage
  - Unique code structure
  - Fast development speed, slow execution speed
  - Specialty in data analyses

- Equivalence
  - ==: Checks the equivalence of two referenced values
  - is: Checks the equivalence of two referenced objects' IDs

## Week 2

### object-oriented paradigm and software design

- Good Software Design
  - Correctness
  - Robustness
  - Flexibility
  - Usability and Reusability
  - Efficiency
- Object-Oriented Design
- Class vs. Instance
  - 설계도 vs. 실행 결과
- Unified Modeling Language (UML) 
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
  - self: reference variable pointing the instance itself
  - super: reference variable pointing the base class instance

- Polymorphism

  - Method Overriding
  - Method Overloading

- Abstract Class

  - A class with an abstract method
  - abstract method: method with signature but with no implementation

- Overriding Methods in object

  - hidden methods

    - ```python
      __init__
      __del__
      __eq__
      __cmp__
      __add__
      ```

  - Duck Typing
    - Easier to Ask for Forgiveness the Permission(EAFP)

- Generalization

  - is-a relationship

- Association
  - has-a relationship

  - Multiplicity of Association
    - 1..*: 1 to Many
    - *: 0 to Many
    - 1: Exactly one
    - 0..1: One or zero

- Aggregation

  - Special has-a relationship
  - part-whole or part-of relationship

- Dependency

  - use relationship
